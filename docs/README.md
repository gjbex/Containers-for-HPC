Singularity can be viewed as the Docker for HPC, i.e., a Singularity image
contains all the operating system/software components for your application
and can be deployed and run on HPC infrastructure, as well as on your own
laptop, and even in the cloud.

An additional advantage of Singularity containers is that they can help
you create a software environment that is stable over long periods of
time, which helps reproduce results in the future.


## Learning outcomes

When you complete this training you will be able to

  * use Singularity containers;
  * create your own definition files for containers;
  * understand strengths and weaknesses of containers;
  * recognize and avoid potential pitfalls.


## Schedule

Total duration: 3 hours.

## Training materials

Slides are available in the
 [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gjbex/Containers-for-HPC/),
as well as example Singularity definition files.


## Target audience

This training is for you if you have some non-trivial workflows on HPC
systems, or reproducibility requirements.


## Prerequisites

You will need to be comfortable using Linux and the HPC environment.
If necessary, attend the appropriate training sessions on those subjects.
